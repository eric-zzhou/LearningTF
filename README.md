# Learning TensorFlow and Keras
Projects and code that were made while I was learning how to use TensorFlow and Keras.
- [TICS-AIML](TICS-AIML): code from Advanced Topics in Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, a course I took in high school. The course covered a variety of topics in AI and ML
  - For [Artificial Intelligence](TICS-AIML/AI) I improved my understanding of informed and uninformed search algorithms such as dfs, bfs, dijstra's, and A*
  - In [Machine Learning](TICS-AIML/ML) I expanded my knowledge of various concepts, learning about [Feature Reduction](TICS-AIML/ML/FeatureReduction), and various models such as [Linear Regression](TICS-AIML/ML/LinearRegression.py), [Kth Nearest Neighbor](TICS-AIML/ML/KNearestNeighbors), [K Means Clustering](TICS-AIML/ML/KMeansClustering), [Convolutional Neural Networks](TICS-AIML/ML/ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks), and [Recurrent Neural Networks](TICS-AIML/ML/RecurrentNeuralNetwork) 
- [numberguessing](numberguessing): a project inspired by the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bte8Er0QhDg), creating a GUI that allows the user to draw a digit and uses a pre-trained MNIST digit-classifier Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the number the user drew
- [tensorflow2tutorials](tensorflow2tutorials): series of small projects made following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lak7tiFDec5_ZMItiIIfmj), including basic neural networks to do clothing item classification and sentiment analysis
- [textsummary](textsummary): text summarizer model inspired by the following [article](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/06/comprehensive-guide-text-summarization-using-deep-learning-python/)
